&gt; She owns a 3 bedroom 2,100 sqft home worth $725k 45 min from Seattle. They took out a 30 year (insane to me) mortgage pre COVID for somewhere between $400-500k.


sell the houseShe has to sell the house. Her income can't support the monthly mortgage payment alone.

If she doesn't, she'll eventually lose it in foreclosure and possibly be pursued for the owed amount, state dependent.sell the house and find a 55+ affordable community or move to another town or state or both into a county and town with very low taxes and home prices and buy house for cash

&amp;#x200B;

this is what my  mom did years ago with no retirement money and retired at 57 or so on SS and her late husband's SSSell the house. Move closer to you in a rental or small condo she pays cash for. Find another job. As a nurse she is v employable. Perhaps in a school + a summer camp. She prob can also pick up seasonal work ( we had an aunt that gave flu shots every fall and made a bunch for a short amount of time).Wow, what a situation.  
I do recommend you help her sell the house.  That is a very large mortgage for someone getting near retirement.  There is so much change going on for her loss of her husband that you most likely do not want her to have to much change all at once. 
Does she want to move closer to you?  Does she want to stay closer to her work?  
I would recommend that she sell the house and rent a small apartment for a while.  Let her get her mind together after such a huge loss of husband and home. 
Good for you for being there for her.Social security survivor benefits?

https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/Double check what her Social security would be as herself and spouse/survivor.This is a difficult situation, I'm sorry that you and your Mom are going through this. My advice is for your Mom to sell the house, clear all her debts and rent a 1 bedroom or studio apartment close to you guys, ideally in walking distance.

Once she is in, established and gets through the mourning period, you can all sit down and come up with a plan for the future. She'll have 2-300k in the bank following the home sale and assuming 1 bedroom rents are roughly 2k a month she could live there for 10+ years just on the proceeds from the house. Now that's not to say that's the plan for the rest of her life but the point is, there's no immediate need to make a lifelong decision. Just get her out of the house and mortgage and close to you guys and then you can take all the time you need to make a future decision.

Good luck.You might want her to live with you after you have that kid.

Just a thought.I'm 62.  Get advice from other people her age.    


 THe vibe I'm getting from the comments is "oh wow, how terrible, she is old and desperate and this is a desperate situation"  


Obviously, the loss of her partner is a big deal but, but apart  from that, I'd be seeing opportunities in her situation.    


Is she healthy?  Active?  Sounds  like there's plenty of money, it's just  a matter of what lifestyle  she wants going forward.    


Call a property manager and see about renting the house.  If you can get that mortgage paid you can relax for a while and figure it out.   


My moms best years were the two decades after my dad died.Selling the house makes sense as others have commented, but maybe you can switch homes with your mom?

Sounds like your mom needs less space, and a townhouse might work well for her assuming she's ok with stairs or it doesn't have multiple floors. Also, you need more space, so a 3br 2100sqft home makes more sense for your growing family.You are not drowning.  As a future CPA, you will face this many times, with many of your clients.  This is a practice session that will help you to help lots of other people throughout your professional life.  So, let's look at assets, investments, employment and Social Security planning and taxes.

Under the terms of the mortgage, is your mother allowed to rent the house out?  If so, is there a rental market in the area that would support your mother renting the house out for $4K monthly?  This would allow her to keep the house, build equity and, hopefully, also see the value increase.  Alternatively, can the house be reconfigured so that part of it can be rented out for $3K monthly while your mother lives there?  If this is not possible, the best alternative may be selling the house and buying a studio condo or something similar in an area like Renton, as another commenter stated.  A reverse mortgage (I've done them for clients) is not recommended.  Your mother needs to maximize what she has and gain more.

Consolidate the small amount of investments and put them into something safe.  Get your mother into the 401K in her workplace and have her max out what she can put away.  

If mom is an RN or an LVN, she should consider working in a hospital at higher pay than what she would get working as a school nurse.  The vision might be work 3 12-hour shifts weekly and make a great deal more than she does now.  If this isn't to her liking, she needs to find a clinic or other practice to move into that will provide her with a significant income increase.  If Kaiser is located in the Seattle area, that could be good to try.  Or working for a pediatric specialist MD.

Social Security should be put off until she is 70 if possible.  So, work until 70, qualify for a much higher Social Security benefit, then look at retirement - which in her case might mean she works 1 or 2 days weekly for the income and to keep her license up.  Get a Social Security report that tells her what her current input into the system has been, and also find out your dad's SSA benefit.  You're looking to max out your mother's benefits.  Does it make sense for her to take early benefits?  Does it make sense for her to claim your dad's SSA record so that she is bumped up to what he received?

Meanwhile, what are the tax ramifications of each of the above?  How can her tax burden be mitigated?This is not a crisis. You mom is working, has a chunk of money from insurance, and an asset that's worth a lot of money. 

She should sell the house, get out of the mortgage, find a smaller place to live or rent for a while, or even live with roommates. 

You could also rent out the house, and use the rental income to cover a mortgage payment on a smaller place. That's more work, but good if you're reluctant to sell in the current market. 

**Your mom should also qualify for your dad's social security benefits** and you need to look into that. 

You're financially fine. There's just a few moving pieces and you're overwhelmed. Your mom is in a secure place financially, and just has a costly mortgage for a place she doesn't need, and less life insurance than maybe she was counting on.She doesn’t get social security survivor benefits?[deleted]So your mother is a school nurse, is she an RN? I realize that with her age, she has to be careful what type of position she would take due to the physical demands. 

Is she vested in a retirement program with the school?
If she is, you might want to explore with her other positions that may pay better and utilize her experience.

As far as the house I think people have given you good advice, it's going to be difficult for her but in the long run it's in her best interest to find something more manageable, and also probably easier to maintain and to age safely in looking to the future.Just wanted to say that I really appreciate you looking out for your family.She needs to sell the house ASAP. Relocate and find a different job.I didn't expect this much of a response! Thank you to all who have contributed. You have all helped ease my mind. Although I am still stressed about making the right decision, I do not feel panicked. I have to work for a bit and will be back to keep checking on reply's. Thank you all again so so much!I’m really sorry for your loss OP. I can’t imagine how hard it is to scramble with an intimidating financial situation while you’re still grieving.

I agree your mom cannot afford a $3k mortgage even if she can increase her hours and get up to $48k in income.

It seems to me, from an outsiders perspective, that your main options are this:

1) She sells her current home and buys something smaller, ideally somewhere reasonably close to both you and her work that will suit her needs for the indefinite future and can be the last place she’ll ever need to move into. I don’t know what a condo goes for in Seattle but it sounds like she could potentially be up by a few hundred thousand on the current house after selling which would go a long way towards that next home. If she can end up owning a house outright, social security will take her a long way even without much in the way of savings. 1b -Alternately, sell and rent but the that puts her on a bit of a ticking clock where it seems like savings could eventually turn into a problem later in retirement.

2) You both sell both of your homes and find a place that will work for a multi-generation family. It would suck to give up your current low interest rate mortgage as you point out. Also something like this is a huge decision with a lot of pros and cons that are more the purview of r/relationships 

3) You sell your house and move in with your mom, taking on part of the mortgage. This could also get messy for similar reasons to #2

Really sorry for your loss OP. This is a horrible situation. Im not like a genius or anything, but just from an outside perspective these seem to be the main options. Maybe someone else will see something I can’t. Your mom is really lucky to have a kid who is so concerned with her well-being

Edit to add: you mention 4k in stock in a single company. Given how little retirement investments your mother has, AFTER you figure out the housing end of things, she should probably sell that all and put the proceeds into a diversified full-market fund or something similarShe should sell her house and rent for a year or two. Your mom is young and life is long you never know what her future holds. Having the freedom of cash with No mortgage will help this stressful year she’s facing.

I’m so sorry for your loss.It sucks that grief has to take a backseat to the 'business of death'. I was this person too after my dad died. You're a good child for focusing helping your mom and I'm so sorry for your loss. Hopefully once you have plans and answers you can take a step back and grieve as needed.

I agree with others about selling the house being Priority #1. Even if she's pretty frugal this change will require a downsize. Re-calculate her monthly income and try to find something where the rental or mortgage payment stays around 30% of her take-home pay. Preferably something in a community where she can stay on the 1st floor as she gets older (duplex, apartment). This may be do-able if the profit from the house can be a large down payment. She needs to use the life insurance for savings, and to be adding to that as well for retirement. Hopefully she would get retirement from her job, but savings are usually still needed.

I'm sure it'll be hard for her to leave her home, but better to do it now when she has the funds to make it happen than to put if off until the situation becomes desperate.An alternative to selling the house is to consider renting it out and moving into a smaller place. Hopefully that adds some income after mortgage expenses. Market isn't favorable for selling generally but not sure what that's like locally. You should do the math of rent vs sell and do tradeoffs.Grace and Frankie it. Have her get two roommates and have them pay 2/3 the mortgage. Makes it so they only have to pay 1 grand a month.Can you not move to her house? Sell yours and live in, what I'm assuming is her larger home. 

Having her around will help a lot when your baby comes around. Everybody wins.Mom doesn’t need you.  She just has to sell her house, downsize to a small apartment and save as much as she can.   I don’t see why you would have to change anything to your lifestyle.   Finding a new place and decorating it to her taste may be a good way to keep busy and start a new chapter in her life.  She’s still young.Can you guys move into her home? Would her house work as a multi-generational home? Do you guys get along well enough to share a home? If you rent from her and share the burden of the mortgage, it could be great to have grandma with you when you have a child. And you could rent your townhouse out to cover your portion (and to have a fallback if she decides to sell, or if you decide you don't want to live there anymore)Sell the house and have her buy a condo close by. She isn’t going to want to do yard work and maintenance either.

I’ve seen marriages go really bad when a parent moves in. Your mom is used to being the boss of her life and home.

The only time I have seen this work out is when it’s the culture of both members of the married couple to live inter-generationally. This is because in those cultures, they revere the elders and everyone knows the oldest person is the boss and final say. So they don’t get bent out of shape with an adult in the household they’re paying for hogging the remote or not doing their share of cooking and cleaning. They just refer to the boss for what’s appropriate and know when they’re the elder, they’ll be boss so it’s fair.Is your mom an RN? With years of experience? She can easily be making $50/hr or potentially significantly more in the Seattle area. School nursing is some of the lower paying nursing work, so she has significant ability to increase her income. If she really wants to keep her current job she could pick up something very part time/flexible like pediatric home care on the evenings/her days off

And she’s living alone in 2100 square feet? She can rent out rooms to travel nurses for good extra income. I believe Furnished Finders is the website many travel nurses/health care workers use. That’s if she doesn’t want to sell for some reason. Selling and downsizing is the obvious answer though

As a long term alternative, and if it would work for you and your wife, could you and mom both sell your houses and join forces to get somewhere that has as ADU for mom to live in?If she is a nurse, there are all kinds of opportunities to make more money than she is.  Even if she doesn't want to be patient facing.  Some of them can even be remote.&gt; My wife and I (27) make $150k together and live in a small townhome outside of Seattle that would not work for a multigenerational family. We are also trying to have our first child soon soon. This was bought for $425k and is now worth $472k.

&gt; My immediate question is what do we do with the house? She won't be able to pay the mortgage once the life insurance runs out and she doesn't want to live in that house alone forever. It is also about 45 min from us and ideally we would like to be closer.

what about selling your house, and moving your family into mom's house and "taking over" that mortgage?

there's 3 bedrooms, so one room for mom, one for you &amp; your spouse, and one for the kid.So many people suggesting she rent out the house.

Run from that idea.  Thats a horrible idea.

If your mom had 300k sitting on the table, would you tell her to invest it in a rental property (with a $400k mortgage added in for good measure)

&amp;#x200B;

Hell no you wouldn't.  Free up that equity and steer it to the best place - either paid off housing for her OR mutual fund investments (which are REALLY good deals right now)I’m so sorry for your family’s loss. It sounds like it was unexpected and that makes it so much harder. 

Financially… as everyone ie saying… sell the house and try to buy a small condo to live in with cash or as much cash down as possible. Continue working as long as she is healthy. Collect her and your dad’s social security as soon as she stops working. 

It won’t be a lavish life but she’ll make it. Maybe you and your wife can buy her a car or something down the road.You did a great job, but unless your mom has cognitive problems, she is the one who needs to make these decisions. And, to some extent, she is the one who has to live with the consequences of her own financial decisions. Don't bulldoze her with your worries about her future. She is grieving, living a new life, and she needs time to process the change and understand what she wants now, as a single, working woman.

Selling the house as soon as possible is daunting, but she is willing and it is necessary, so jumping on that is probably the best thing to do. You and your family can help her with that, but it is her house and the decisions around it and everything in it are hers to make.

Don't be surprised if she would prefer to move into her own apartment. Where she lives should be entirely her decision. Your contribution should be to let her talk about what she wants and to help facilitate that, while respecting her need to live within her means.

I'm 5 years older than your mom, and I would resent anyone else thinking that I was not competent to take care of myself. You clearly love her, and your intentions are the best. But you are not her keeper. Be there to listen and let her breathe.55+ condos are so much more affordable. Sell house, pay for condo with home equity/sale proceedsRent out the house! Based on the numbers it looks like a very low interest rate (\~3%ish?)Banks aprowe 30 year mortgage to 70year olds???
Sell the house.Did they own the house outright and got a cash out refinance before Covid? If so, where'd that cash go? If they'd just purchased the house during Covid and they have a low rate that would suck to lose, I'd ask 2 things:

1. Is her town someplace you'd like to live? Could you and your wife take over her house payments and live there with her? It may help to have her when you have your own child. If you and your wife would not want to live with her, could you swap housing?

OR

2. Could you rent out their house &amp; make enough to cover house expenses and make some additional income for her? She could then a 1/1 someplace until she has some time to plan when cooler heads and hearts prevail?

I wouldn't sell the house at this time unless it is absolutely necessary. It's never good to make such major decisions in the middle of an emotional crisis. As time passes and you all get your bearings in this new chapter, you may see other options you can't see right now.

Wishing you luck and healing.What did they do with the loan money 400-500k?Why not move into her house with her?Dude how is this even a question? Sell the house, buy a condo closer to you. You could EASILY find a nice 1 br condo for less than 250k.If she’s a school nurse, my assumption is that she’s a licensed nurse. She can make way more money taking a different job in a clinical setting. If she doesn’t want to do this, she can get a second job for the summer she has off.Sell the house. She should move into a 55+ apartment as the rents can be lower, and she will have a ready made group of friends. I had to move my mom and disabled sister into a 55+ apartment and they resisted at first, but once there loved that they could ususally find someone to talk to by walking down the hall, or downstairs, etc. These places have football watching parties, crafting groups, all sorts of activities, and your mom could start one if she wanted. 

Renting at her age and income is actually a good idea. And, you will not be the one fixing little things all the time. And, if she's in a 55+ place, you will be less responsible for her social life - which can get old after a while if she's leaning on you for socializing.

Make sure she knows to not spend more than she can pay off each month on her one or two credit cards (get rid of the rest). And, only one car.

Be sure she is clear on how to budget, even setting up a basic spreadsheet to go over with her ever two weeks to make sure she's living within her means.

Your mom is eligible for your dad's Social Security when she is ready to take social security, I think. I know that's true for widows already on SS.

Good luck.Your mom should sell and consider Renton.So sorry for your loss.

Was the 400-500k mortgage taken out on the house they already owned (home equity), or taken to buy the house she's in currently?[deleted]I am not 100% sure, but I believe she can claim social security survivor benefits right now, while letting her own benefit accrue to the maximum possible at age 70, at which point she can switch to that one. https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/survivorchartred.html. 

You said your house was not suitable for her moving in, but you could consider moving in with her and renting your house out. You could also consider helping her find a roommate to contribute rent - I would think a similar age woman would be ideal. I would guess that finding a new 3rd house is probably not a good plan due to the interest rate difference though. 

If none of those options work she is going to have to sell the house pretty soon, unless you subsidize the costs.She is in better shape than half the country. Sell the house asap. Don't go into the summer months before it is listed. Seasonality matters with real estate. If she can stay with you for a few months while she finds something else that would be ideal. Pay cash for something on one level. Preferably single family but something with a low condo fee can also work. With her income, social security, and no house payment she will be fine and should be able to age with dignity.The absolute worst thing anyone can ever do is not have a plan when ur gone.   Ill leave it at that without getting banned.Get roommates - aka house hacking. 

I own a 3 bedroom my mom is living out of.

We converted the living room to an additional bedroom, and my mom now has 3 roommates. I do have to sort through a rotating cast of roommates that are often incompatible for one reason or another, and it took 2 years of this before I arrived at the current cast (which she likes). It wasn't easy.

But - at the end of the day, I am paying for the $400k mortgage, and keeping some cash flow on top, from the rent I get from the other 3 bedrooms.

It isn't super comfortable, but my mom loves the idea of the money saved, as she is a very (extremely) frugal person. And she isn't paying any rent.Did they buy the house with the 30y loan? If not, the "own" part of the house is not accurate. If it is worth that much, she needs to sell it.Y'all could also move away from Seattle somewhere that has low cost of living and kid friendly. All live in same house. 

I know it isn't what you have planned, but life throws us curve ballsYour mom can start collecting social security now and get survivors benefits from your dads social security. I suggest she do the paperwork asap. 

Other than that, she needs to sell the house as soon as possible because the payments on that are going to consume what little cash she has. Forget the renting it out ideas and reverse mortgages. That all come with severe mental damage and doesn’t solve her money problem. Sell the house and move on. 

If she can’t move in with you, I suggest you find a nice 1 br apartment somewhere she likes and simply accept you are going to be paying for it in perpetuity. 

I sympathize. My parents were the same. Almost zero retirement planning and so when my dad died my mom was left homeless and destitute. I love(ed) my parents but I will forever be upset that they planned so little with the assumption that someone else would figure it out for them when they both made comfortable incomes their entire
Lives and spent a lot on expensive cars and vacations the last 20 years of their lives and it ended up costing my wife and I ~$400K in savings to deal with it and provide my mom a comfortable living situation the remaining 6 years of her life.Seattle is expensive as hell. Sell the house and consider moving somewhere else. $150k combined income in a place that expensive is insane - you could find comparable income with significantly cheaper real estate elsewhere…..probably with better weather too.Is your mom cool? Why not move in to her house for a few years? She can help
With the baby and you can rent out the condo? Also help her with the mortgage/bills.Use the equity from the house to get a condo.Sell your house &amp; mom’s. Move out of Seattle. Get a bigger home &amp; set ground rules for privacy. A home with a kitchen &amp; a room on the lower level would be perfect for your mother downstairs, &amp; you guys upstairs. Mom is older, stairs won’t work for her forever.

If you &amp; your wife want to keep your jobs, you’re gonna have to commute to make this work. Mom is a nurse, she’s desirable even as a school nurse. She can work close to the new home.

If not that, an apartment or condo community for 50+ for your mom close to you. Either way, it’s smarter to move her out of the city.Sell the house. Now. You’re going in to the spring market, so now is the best time to sell this year. Do not let her get under water. Look into a condo and make sure they have a very healthy HOA so she doesn’t get hit with a special assessment. 

Look into social security benefits. I am no expert, but I believe your mom should be entitled to your father’s benefits. 

Move your mom closer to you. This will make your life easier. Your mom is still young, but she might need your help more often with your dad being gone. 

She needs to find a better paying job (depends on SS benefits). If she’s an RN she could make more. She could also look into travel nursing if she’s open to an adventure. 

And lastly, I’m so sorry for your loss.Yeah, sell her home, pay off that mortgage, use leftover to purchase a small condo (likely not a home as that wouldn’t leave much to live off).I empathize with your situation. My objective mind would say sell the house and help her get a small condo. In the US she would get half her husband's social security no? In Canada the widow receives a survivor pension. She cannot afford to keep living in the house essentially.First thing is sell the house, or you sell your house and move in with mom.  You help with payments, she signs house over to you.  You now have the house for your familyRent your place and move in with her. Have her add you to her mortgage. After a couple years you could move further from Seattle and rent both places for well over the mortgage with how crazy rates are. This could allow enough extra cash flow to get another home with mil apartment or above the garage apartment for her.Sell the house and she has $300k to supplement her income. 

Renting a smaller place seems the way to go.

She has the $300k to fall back on then.She needs to sell the house ASAP as others said. Tell her to find an apartment.Sell the house and move into an apt closer to you. It’ll work in both your favors when you have a child.Sell the house, pay off debt and move into affordable housing.Sell the current home and take out a new mortgage on a small condo. Sell asap, so as to not drain her savings.   
Renting forever wouldn't be all that bad if she moves into a senior citizen apartment building. They charge an affordable rent, no maintenance, and a social life. Often these buildings have long waiting lists, so if she's in agreement, get her name on the lists.   
Contact Social Security to get an estimate of her widows benefit amount so you know what her income will be.Any plan begins with selling the house. Get the house on the market ASAP.

Once the house is sold, she can either move into a rental or buy a condo or townhome. A rental is probably more realistic with her modest means. Possibly she could rent for a year while you figure out if it makes sense to buy a property that could house all of you.

Have you looked into social security survivor's benefits for her?Question- why was the life insurance pay out only 10% of its value?My condolences for your loss;  I'm so sorry.  These are hard decisions, but the advice to sell is good.  And not just for immediate monthly bill reasons.  The upkeep on a house may be beyond her.  And, depending on the state of maintenance, you all may be looking at investments to keep it in sellable state that will eat larger sums as well.  Example:  HVAC, roof, plumbing.  The absence of resources will make dealing with unexpected things like that when faced with lower monthly incomes will shove you all into the red very, very quickly.Sorry about your Dad. What a painful situation. 

First, as someone with a kid and parents close, don't underestimate the value of having family nearby. There is a point in life you want to distance yourself from your parents, but when kids come in the picture (assuming you have a good relationship) it can be a benefit. So look on that part as a positive. 

You need to take a whole view of your Mom's current and future situation. She's still a few years away from her full retirement age (should be 65 or 66 for her IIRC) and I'd advise to plan to hold out as soon as she can. Does she get survivor SS benefits from your dad in addition to her working? I would get someone to look at the best option for her on when/how to get the max SS benefits. 

I think as others said, there may be enough equity in the home to make this easier. I would see what's available near you (condo or otherwise) that she can buy outright with teh proceeds from the house. I know prices are crazy, and that may not be possible, but there's a world where she could get \~ $250K is looks like from the house. Even with a small mortgage that could be very doable with her income. 

Agree, unfortunately, she should up her hours if possible. 

Otherwise, I don't think there is much to do. Sell the house, move closer, try to find something that gets her to a $0 or close to $0 mortgage, BANK any life insurance to give her some savings, and then work with an accountant to figure out the best way to maximize her SS benefits. 

Best of luck!Renting isn't a bad thing if there is a 55+ affordable community near her. It could be less stressful to not have to deal with maintenance and property taxes, insurance, etc.Sell the house and get her into one of those 55+ communities. Also if she is an RN she can look into contract nursing, doesn't have to be travel. She can do local contracts for 13 week periods.Can she get his Social Security benefits now, or does she have to wait until she's 65?  

Definitely sell the house.  Put it on the Market tomorrow.  

The current mortgage rates are fine.  They are not the amazing rates of a few years ago, but they are still lower than the historical average. 

Having grandma close by to babysit for free while you and your wife work will more than pay for whatever adjustments you need to make.  Childcare is obscenely expensive.  Plus she has at least $200k in property profit and a portion of it could be used to contribute to the new house, with the rest setup with a metered payout of CDs or iBonds so they can earn some interest above any checking account inflation (like a 6 month, 1yr, 2yr, 5yr...).  

My Inlaws have always lived less than five minutes away and for the last 5 years they have been living in the basement of the house we bought with the intention to convert that space to an apartment for them.  It has a bedroom and full bath and the bar was easy to convert into a full kitchen.  And the unfinished space is now a huge woodshop.  They pay a monthly "rent" contribution to the family finances, we pay all utilities, the house is nearly always occupied and the kid doesn't have to hang out with a stranger before or after school.  And I actually see them less than I did back when they had to drive over to watch the kid. 
Since it's your mother and not your wife's, you will be responsible for setting boundaries and ensuring she sticks to your kid's routine, not just re-does whatever "worked for you".  Don't let your wife be the bad guy.  

Two of my wife's cousins have also done the same with their parents.  One just moved their mom into a room upstairs and another bought a small prefabricated home and just plopped it on the side of their land.Sell the house, and possibly look into relocating to a cheaper part of the country.Sell the house and find the least expensive rental for her, a bit closer to you.  I wouldn’t make any huge decisions like buying an in-law setup at this point.  Let yourselves grieve a while,  take a breath and get out of the immediate emergency (the house that is way too much for her)…other than that wait 6 months and see how things are going and then reevaluate.  I’m sorry for your loss.She’s a nurse. Time for some per diem shifts. 

I am really sorry for your loss, this is awful.What happened to the money for the house?

Are you saying they just bought it pre COVID? Because it reads like they took out a note on a house they already ownedA reverse mortgage is an option, but your mom would still be on the hook for property taxes and insurance.  On a $36k a year income, that would be very difficult. 

A better option is for her to sell the home, bank the proceeds, and rent somewhere near you. The option of you selling your home and getting a mother in law apt, would mean you would lose any equity in your house now (the little appreciation you have will be negated in closing costs/realtor fees). 

Worst case scenario, your mom sells her house, you sell your, and you buy a home with an extra room (no mother in law apartment). She lives with you as a co-tenant.Can she collect your dad’s social security as a spouse? He seemed old enough. Your mom needs to downsize and reduce expenses. If she’s not onboard, it’s only going to get worse. I hope it goes well for all of you.If your mother needs additional money to hold things over until the house is sold she could sign up with some nursing agencies and pick up shifts here and there. Depending on what her speciality is you can often make over $1000 a day. I realize that’s not a long term solution but it may help.Why don’t you swap the houses as it seems like you’d need a bigger house and can afford it if it’s not way out of your way to work or other destinations.Can you add a addition to your house for her?I had friends in similar situations. They sold the house and had an addition built on or a back house. Increased the value of their home and their mom was able to help with kids.Everyone is saying sell the house.  But, maybe considering a renter if she is open to it could be an option. Does she have any friends that need financial relief that might want to split rent?  Even if it was just until she could catch her breath and then decide what to do?You could see about getting a home big enough for multigenerational living. And if you have a child she could be a wonderful addition for support and child rearing.Sell your house and move into the bigger house at a low rate? Mom can choose to live in one of the bedrooms or you can find a place to rent nearby?Contact Social Security and get an appointment for your mom. It may take a while to be seen, so just get the appointment now.

It is possible to collect on widow/survivor benefit (starting at 60, so she qualifies there) and delay collecting on your own record till 70 (if your own benefit is more than your survivor benefit). My MIL did this herself.

There are a lot of details to consider in this case, so it's difficult to nail down what her options look like until she talks with a Social Security rep. A lot of rules changed a few years back, so if you Google around, you may find outdated info.Move in with her, rent out your townhome. Get you and your wife added to the deed. Get house paid off over time, keep town home as investment. Once mom passes you can use rental income history from townhome plus equity in home to get a place where you want it, then rent out the house.I’m sorry for your loss. I wanted to suggest some  alternative and/or additional employment options for your mom. It sounds like she is an RN with a background in pediatrics and possibly labor and delivery.

Unfortunately school nursing is just about the lowest paid employment for an RN.  However, if that’s all she’s comfortable with, she could shop around at other school districts and/or work at camps during the summer.

Some commenters suggested employment in a hospital and/or travel nursing. However unless your mom was very recently employed in a hospital setting I’d say that would be very difficult if not impossible. But there are many other options!

She could work peds home health or hospice, either through an agency or private duty.  

Telephone triage/advice nurse for a pediatric clinic (some may want a background in ER/urgent care).

Insurance claims review (would require computer skills)

Instructor at a local nursing school, esp if she has at least a BSN. She could help with skills labs, simulations, or clinical instruction.

In a HCOL area like Seattle, I’m guessing she could make at least $25-35/hr as a nanny or night nurse/postpartum doula.

Finally she could teach CPR and/or childbirth education classes.

Best of luck to you and your family.I would take my chick and move in with my momma . Make some type of agreement on paying the mortgage 💸 and other bills. I would stay with my mom and help her for as long as she needs me. That way we can mourn together and heal together. Small sacrifice for the ones we love. It’s your mom brother step up to the plate and be that rock for your family. Keep GOD FIRST and HE will see you through!Sell the house, your mum moves in with you, kids get put on hold until the situation is sorted.

I have done this in the past with my Brother, his partner left him, he tried to kill himself. When he was released from hospital we got rid of his place and moved him in with us (Me my wife, and the one teenage son at the time) and I looked after him and got him back on his feet with a job and a place of his own.

We were earning next to nothing at the time, and it was a financial burden that we couldnt really afford while he wasnt working, but its family, and they would do it for you.If she has such a low rate on the house why not hold onto it as a rental property? Over the years she would be banking money on principal and providing additional income immediately. 

If she went that route she can rent something more aligned with her budget till you figure out a longer term plan.If she's an RN, she could make about twice that salary working part-time for PeaceHealth clinics/hospitals.&gt; Retirement of around 4k in single stock
&gt; basically no cash savings

I know this is a difficult time for you OP, but what the hell was your father's original retirement plan? Even if he was making significantly more money than your mom, the two of them had no retirement accounts at all?The mortgage on the house doesn't add up.  The payments as stated 3k for 30 years is just over 1 million.  At 3% on a 30 year loan for 500k the payment would be $2150 roughly. 
I would highly suggest going back and double checking all your numbers.
Also,  be open to the possibility of renting it - this way she could retain it and potentially make a profit off it while deciding what she wants to do and where to go.  I think a retirement community as others suggested would be a great idea!I'm not sure about the rest, but you can check out the Senior Housing Action Group (SHAG) for places where she might want to move to - I was very relieved to find them when I moved my mother up here.I’m going to go against the grain.  Your mom’s mortgage is a lot cheaper than renting a lot of places in the Seattle area right now. She should keep it until the economy in the area improves if she can. 

Washington state requires people acting as a school nurse to be an RN.  If her license is current, she really should look into many of the remote nursing jobs available.  Or work for an insurance company. This should drastically increase he annual income.  

Besides covering rent and basic necessities, she should save as much money as possible. 


Do not forget about SSA survivor benefits.She needs to sell the house immediately.  She can’t take the risk of renting it out like others are saying.    Any economic downturn would crush her.   Once you sell the house she should find something she can PAY OFF with the equity.   Doest matter if it is small, small, small.   She needs to eliminate her housing expense as she has little money or income.   Then she needs to work more and save.  

Do not take you mother in your house with a mother in law suite under any conditions.   You would be asking for financial and relationship ruin, perhaps with her and your wife.   Do not ruin your financial life, your parents got themselves in this position through their own choices 

Get her on a budget and have her work more.   Best thing she can do is eliminate her housing outflow and get her budget in order and start a retirement savings.  

She is in a difficult place and your dad left her there.  A lot of people are in the same place, it’s the American way of living above your means.   

As to the long term care insurance.   Do the math but it may not be worth it.   She doesn’t really have any assets and probably needs the money of the monthly premium.   Long term care is really meant to protect asset.   If she has not assets she would go into a Medicaid facility if necessary.    

She can live an ok life if she gets her housing covered, keeps working and gets on a budget.I can't add any possible advice that hasn't already been mentioned, but I wanted to say that my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family in this difficult time, your mother truly is fortunate to have raised such a caring child and I hope you can work through this tough time together.Sell the house and see if you can put a tiny house on wheels in your backyard for mom (100k+/-). She can roll it wherever she wants as things change such as a trailer or tiny house community and you may potentially benefit from it in the future as well after she passes. It's on wheels so unless you have an HOA, i doubt you'll run into much hassle.well either your mom is downsizing and moving into a mobile home or a condo or you are expanding to include your mom by selling two homes and getting a something that does fit a multi generational situation.


In the meantime you need to sell literally everything. Don’t get emotionally attached. Sell it.I would try to rent the house out. The equity is nice but turning it into cash isn’t going to make it last any longer. She should be able to easily recoup her costs and have some cash flow. When she gets older that equity in the home will have grown astronomically. 

With her job making 3k a month with the cash flow from the rental income and maybe a little help from you guys (if needed) of like 500/month she should be easily able to situate herself 

I think selling this home is a very poor decision, despite what others are telling you. She does need to move out though.I'd urge her to sell the house and rent an apartment. Maybe look into Seattle's Senior Housing program. Rent is charged based on income level. At her current income (at 4 days a week), she could get a two-bedroom for less than $1100/mo, with water sewer, and garbage included. And she could use the equity in the house to build a savings/retirement account.  She doesn't necessarily have to rent there forever. You and your wife could eventually in a few years upgrade to a house with an in-law suite when you have a better idea of the market, have built up some equity, and are making more money, and have her move in with you then.Are you and your wife opposed to living with her in her house and renting out your place?Something to be very careful about: Make sure YOU and MOM are extremely aware of who owes what debs. 

Anything that was in Dad's name exclusively dies with him.  Collections agencies can and will call trying to collect, and could get Mom to agree to pay Dad's debts "because it's what people in polite society do".  

But fuck that.  Discover &amp; Mastercard have enough money, and they're the ones that let a 75yo man rack up 30 years of debt.  

So make sure whatever debt Dad has dies with him.   Spring for a Lawyer if you run into a grey area or want to see how much you could push the limits. It shouldn't cost much, and could save you thousands.  

While you're at the lawyer, make sure you get Mom to sign a will and set up her own estate.  Learn from the mistakes Dad made.Lesson here is to not have a mortgage at the age of 62 or 72!!! Home ownership for most Americans is an investment for later life at the time of retirement. 
The house was purchased 30+ years back and then sold at the time of retirement. The new downsized home would’ve been paid off by the equity earned.sell your townhome - move into moms house -- you all split the payments and bills. i don't know the legality of it - but maybe she can add you to the mortgage as well in case something happens to her... you and your wife make more than enough to pay 3k a month.

if you do this you will have a big nice house for your family including having mom ( grandmom around- who you will want around to help if you have a baby.  trust me - you are going to want all the help you need. we have a 7month old and we are paying a shit ton for a full time nanny - not to mention the mortgage and all the other normal bills.She needs to try to sell as soon as the market rebounds to keep from owing the bank money. Start working full time. Let’s be clear about this. She doesn’t own a home. She is leasing the home. She needs to consider a much much cheaper living arrangement and not get into another huge mortgage especially at her age. Perhaps a senior living community where they have trailers that she can purchase for under 50k. 
In addition, you making only 150k is not enough to purchase a 425k house. Im surprised the bank approved this loan and living in seattle, 150k combined income is not enough, especially if you are trying to have a baby. Child care alone is thousands of dollars a year. Do not repeat the financial mistakes learned from elders as it will land you exactly where your mom is now.. over extended and underwater with no savings, scraping by each month. Even though a bank will give you all that money doesn’t mean you should or can afford to spend the total limit.Condolences. I'm far from being financially wise. So, take my suggestions with a grain of salt but why not move in with her (I know this may not be ideal, but here in Hawaii, multigenerational homes are pretty normal). Get on the mortgage. Bigger space to raise a family. Rent out your current townhouse. It'll probably be the same if not less mortgage payment you currently are paying with the three of you combined. Also, if your mom isn't working full time, she can assist with childcare once you guys do start a family.Why not move into the house with mom? Sell your condo, take that equity and save it.  Pay mortgage with mom. If it has a basement, slowly turn basement into suite for mom.Sad story, I would sell the house immediately. Good thing she is old enough for a 55+ which could be cheaper. I’d stick her in a situation where can can fully afford to live off her income, and in 3 years her SS will kick in. 

I would take the all the profits from the house and use it for a small downpayment on a cheap apartment and the rest saved as backup. 

She has $800/week to spend so she needs to get smart. As messed up as this sounds don’t go draining any of your money rn. It won’t be long until you both are in the same situation.Is it possible that  op  can move in with mom?  I know it isn't ideal but it is an option. My dad passed away seven months ago, so I can understand the mess you guys are in
. My dad didn't have a will and was very sick.   He got sick fast and unfortunately we didn't have time to make sure everything was set up.
Luckily I live next door to my mom. 
Op. I'm so sorry for your loss.She is being severely underpaid even as a school nurse. It could depend on her degree LPN versus RN. Secondly, see if she qualifies for retirement benefits from your dad.\- Get Mom on Social Security. You will need a death certificate because she can get come of your Dad's Social Security.

\- Look into any and all government programs available for your Mom: Food stamps, low-income housing, etc. Might be worth talking to a social worker at whatever department in your state helps people. (In my state it's the Department of Community Health.)

\- Sell the house and get Mom into a smaller place, near you.Is your moms house big enough for your growing family to move into till interest rates drop? It sounds like they have the larger home and more valuable. You could sell yours, and help take over the payments till it’s the right time to sell. Your mom could stay at 4 days a week and it would take burden off everyone. 

My husband and I are house searching and with interest… you are looking at the same mortgage cost as they have now to find something with a mother in law suite. This option would save moving/buying cost. Allow your mom more time to mourn her husband and give you and your husband access to a larger home to raise a family. It would allow you to help figure your moms finances out more and be closer to her.  I am making the assumption you and your mom and the same level relationship as me and my mom. I would be doing the same thing you are for my mom. Living with parents can be hard, but it can be worth it.&gt;Both my mom and I also currently have low COVID level mortgage rates.

Paying a low interest rate on an unsustainable debt is not a situation to be preserved. 

Say her mortgage is 500k and assume all other debts and savings work out to 0.

That means she's probably got about $225k for a home. Start there. Will that get her somewhere suitable near where you guys intend to be long term? Clinging on to a good interest rate on a bad debt is crazy, and this mortghage right now is a really bad debt

Does she have a pension / any plan for retirement income? She isn't going to be able to work full time for ever, and needs a backup in case she can no longer work due to health or age.Weird how you say she 'owns' a house. That would have been the solution, but in fact she's not even close to owning that house so it's the main problem. Do other people really think they 'own' a house when they have a mortgage? She could also rent it out now. That could bring in income and she could move into a small apartment.No mention of Social Security? Sounds like your father wasn’t collecting (I’m not sure why not, at age 70), but your mother should be entitled to a survivor’s benefit, as well as her own, if she opts to start collecting early (age 63). You might consider seeking advice on that topic, before making any other decisions.If you are the only child, and you and your wife get along VERY well with your Mum. I would sell your current house, and use the equity to pay towards your Mum's mortgage, and you both move in with her. Adjust the deed so that you are the holder, safe guarding the property just incase your Mum's LTC insurance doesn't cover jack. And draw up a rental lease stating your Mum has to pay $x until the mortgage is free and clear. Again, for your protection, just incase her LTC craps out, you can use her SS, or a portion of, to pay the mortgage if her LTC insurance doesn't cover everything.

If you chose this option speak to an elder attorney to cover yourself.Rent the house out and use the funds to rent something much cheaper. Be sure to have good rental insurance.What school nurse only mays 36k? How? My moms friends is a school nurse and she makes 6figs!This isn’t help for you, OP, but I wanted to highlight part of your dad’s experience as a warning for others: 
When your life insurance is through your employer, you will lose it if you 
R employment ends. 

I work in an industry that’s prone to layoffs, and I made it a point to get independent life insurance. 

You should also have life insurance with a payout that equals your mortgage payoff.Didn't look at all the responses, but has she filed for Social Security benefits as surviving spouse?  Check out this page:

[https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/ifyou.html](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/ifyou.html)

I'm all for multi-generational families.  If you think you can make it work, I'd say sell both houses and combine households.  There are a lot of options out there, but one thing seems clear... her current house may be too much for her, both physically and emotionally.  Time your exit out of the house so that you can maximize the equity she has in it.

All is not forsaken.  A path will be made clear.  Consult your professionals... Real Estate Agents, Tax Advisers, Financial Advisers and Attorneys.She is 62. Let's say she lives 30 years more. Renting a small place near you might be cheaper than taking on the taxes, insurance, maintenance of a house. A condo could be nice although I bet they are expensive in your area. HOA dues are a crap shoot - they can easily go up substantially (they never seem to go down). They can be a hefty payment and you still have the taxes and insurance.Don’t worry you got this
Mourn ur dads loss but u still have ur mom, 
It might not seem like it rn but money House mortgage everything is just details you’ll conquer with time. No one’s supposed to be perfectly prepared for this. Gather yourself, then, take the rational decisions with confidenceIf it were me, based on what you said, I would sell your house and move into hers.Sorry for your loss :(. Hope y’all get this worked outYour mither should get your father's social security, yes? How much is that per month?Was your father taking his Social Security at this point because as his widow, she can claim the higher of his or her own benefits iirc.Sell your place and move (bought from her down the road) to the 3 bedroom? 

Unless you absolutely can't live with her.....then have her selling the placeMy dad passed 3 years ago leaving my mom in a very similar boat as a public school teacher. It took two years of gentle convincing but we finally got her to sell the house and purchase a mother daughter with us. Otherwise she would have been up shit’s creek, though she really tried to convince herself that it wasn’t the case. 

It’s so important to be patient and let the surviving spouse feel like they have some modicum of control. I feel for you all in this situation and I’m so sorry for you loss. It’s a tough road ahead but one of life’s greatest honors in learning how to care for those who once cared for us.What about selling your condo and moving into your mom's house with her? Can the three of you afford the expenses?Can you rent out your house and live with her (help with the mortgage) for some time?Sorry for your loss. No advice per see, but let this be a lesson to others: don't rely on life insurance from your job.I don’t know your work situation (in office or remote) but Is there the option to rent or sell your condo and you move in with your mother in her house (2,100 sqft big enough)?  On the topic of kids, we moved closer to our parents which was huge in helping with our kids when they were very young.  Moving in would help out tremendously with having a third adult to help and babysit, etc.

Has your mother explored Social Security spousal benefits?  Is you mom covered by medical insurance through work?I would rent out her house.  $4000/month Rent should cover the mortgage, insurance, property tax and 10% for maintenance. If it is less than that, sell the house. 

There is already a mortage with a low interest rate. 

Check with the social security office. She might get some benefits as a spouse. 

Find an apartment somewhere closer to you and her work.If she doesn’t want to sell the house than I recommend her renting out the other rooms to make the difference. 
I’d even rent the whole house to pay for a apt at a retirement community/ apptThe house is going to drown her. Is there any possibility that she could rent most of the house and continue to live there? Selling seems like a good option but I understand it could be tough right now. Be very very careful if you want to rent by the room I'm not sure what the regulations are in that area other than very tenant friendly.Sorry for your loss, why not move her in with you and your wife?Sell the house asap and hopefully she can net around $250k from the sale. That takes care of the $3k monthly payment which is not even 9 months to deplete her whole savings. If I were you, and if you can afford it, help her out with the mortgage payment for 1-2 months so she can sell and not eat into any savings. 

What stock? I would generally tell her to sell and use the $4k to pay off the credit card balance. It’s just numbers. 

At the end of the day, she needs to find a place where she can purchase for around $225k. Then with her $48k salary and a $25k savings, she will be just fine.Try not to freak out.  That won't help anything.  Ask yourself what a millionaire would do in this situation if the problem was scaled up.  Reach out to other trusted friends or family members and ask for their opinion/support on your situation.I don't know Seattle markets at all, but one question I would ask - 

Is her house rentable, and could you handle being a landlord?  It could create a cash flow to help her move closer to you.I'm afraid this is going to happen with my mom. The problem is my parents don't want to take care of it now. They have a house where my dad also borrowed against it. All retirement they have is social security.Where did they live prepandemic?That’s a lot of house. Rent out a room to some college kid. I don’t know Seattle prices, but enough to help split the mortgage and utilities. 

Talk to a broker about the stock and potentially sell.Sell the house. Use that money for mom to live in a small apartment for 3 or 4 years.She may be able to rent out the house and cover the mortgage + get income from it.  A good realtor in her area can find a property manager who can take care of all the normal "landlord" stuff so she doesn't have to.

I'd focus on getting the house on the market or for rent by the end of the school year, since she is a school nurse.  If she likes her area and has friends there, she may want to rent an apt. for a while there and continue with her job but look for more.

There's no reason to rush to sell her house, or your house, or to buy a condo for her or a new house with an ADU.  Renting out her house will give you time to figure out where she wants to live and work.Sorry for not giving advice on the situation, but this is a very good reason to always maintain some level of life insurance outside of employment.First off, I'm very sorry for your family's loss. 

Don't panic. I know you are feeling overwhelmed and want to fix all this as quickly as possible, but this isn't a problem that can, or needs to, be solved instantly. Take a deep breath, and frame your thinking on this as an ongoing process that will take time to get through. Your mom isn't in danger of being on the street any moment. You can both take the time you need to grieve and weigh options. 

Selling the house is a given - that's too much house for 1 person and too high of a mortgage payment to keep up with on her income. You're also on the right path by looking into SS benefits. 

Bottom line, there is no reason to believe that helping your mom means putting your own family's finances in jeopardy. If you and she can both stay practical and realistic, you can figure out a plan that will work. Best of luck.Mom's only 62.    Is she retired or working?Since she has a pre COVID rate for her mortgage, rent the house out for more than the mortgage and have her use the monthly surplus to rent somewhere else. (I see some suggesting a 55+ community which is a great idea) That way it's basically free for her to live somewhere, with the addition of gaining equity and also paying down her principle. 

Seattle is a whole different crazy game then anywhere else. If the house was bought for $450kish and is now worth $725kish, she will be able to get good rent for it and should have zero problem renting it out. 

I'm in the Seattle area and when we buy our next house we will rent our current house out because that's the best way to financially tackle the crazy Seattle housing market.First. I would call the lender and ask for them to allow you to pause the payments on the house. 

I imagine the CC is pretty high Apr. If you can afford. I would pay that off for your mother. I'm not sure if they had any property of value such as watches, guns, tools, collectibles, etc. But i would imagine you could get your 4-5k back from this. 

The only non absurd way i see to keep the house is to sell the condo, you pay the mortgage and move in. If it's big enough for the 3 of y'all+ potential child/children. 

Can't tell if you own the condo. 

Can really stress the marriage if there isn't ample space. 

The other options are moving to a lower cost of living area.. 

That mortgage is the real kicker. 

What health is your mother in? How much longer is she willing to work? Does the school district give pension or anything?How recently was he let go from his job? If his death was within 90 or so days, his policy *may* have had a provision that the policy could be paid out with just the premiums for those months being deducted (probably just a few hundred or a few thousand dollars less)

Either way, it's *absolutely* with looking into.Sell the house, rent/buy a trailer in a retirement/55+ community. Live comfortably and be as happy as she can be. Sorry for your guys loss.I’m not understanding the question sell the house as soon as possible. Best she has to find something she can afford or find a new better paying jobI don't see anything about the father's social security retirement, which the mother would now get. There is a lot to look into in this regard, e.g., comparing mother's potential SS benefits in the future. Mother will need health insurance. So she should continue working for benefits, if at all possible, until at least the age of 65.What's the APR on the loan?  If it's &lt;4%, rent the house out, and use the money to cover your mother's rent on a 1 BR apartment.

Or better yet, is you have no siblings transfer the house to your name.  You rent out the house AND cover your mother's 1BR apartment rent.  Then she has no assets and qualifies for medicare.  You then get an asset after her passing.She's getting robbed as a school nurse. She can work for an agency making double that super easy with same hoursA 30 year fixed rate mortgage is extremely normal. You say you own a home, so I’m surprised you don’t have the same setup. She doesn’t need a reverse mortgage, she needs to sell the house. Use whatever equity she gets out of it to buy a condo for her, closer to you. Her monthly payments would be much lower in a condo.Would she be interested in taking another higher paying job. If she is a nurse she could make double that amount by moving to a clinic or hospitalThe Social Security Administration estimates your mom's life expectancy from here out as ~23-24 years.

https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/longevity.cgi

Just something to keep in mind.  The profit from selling the house might support her 25% of the way there.  It will have to be a supplement rather than a solution.I'm sorry for your loss.  

Don't forget to heck into Social Security.  She may be qualified for some survivors benefits, as she's over 60.  https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/ifyou.htmlOP, I'm so sorry for the loss of your dad. These scenarios are truly nightmares, but I think you have a lot of hope that your mom will not be left in a bad situation. 

I would go with her to meet with a financial planner. Perhaps she may have access to one through her school district. My mom is a teacher, and she always met with one through her union. Idk if your mom has union representation, but if she does, that'd be a good starting point. They can dig more into her possible SS income, etc. Does she have any sort of pension being a school employee? If so, would she lose some of that if she were to move in with you temporarily and take a job close to you instead?

Unless you and your spouse could and would be willing to move in with your mom and/or sell or rent your place, I think your mom should sell her home. From an optimistic standpoint, this is a great time of year to be gearing up for a sale, and good realtors have experience in this area and could make this a smooth(er) transition for her. I feel really bad, though, that not only did she lose her husband, but she likely will be out her house soon, too. A super alternate would be that she could rent some rooms out, but that's a setup that is very particular, market-dependent (is she near a local university?) and you have to be mentally prepared as a landlord. All things she may not be up for as a grieving spouse.

Nurses continue to be in high demand, even substitute school nurses. Perhaps she could move in with you and find work as a personal care worker through the county or a private agency. She might earn a much higher income doing so. But it definitely sucks to leave your routine, so if she can keep working where she is for the next year or so, that would probably be best for her well-being. She may really need her work and colleagues as a distraction right now.

My grandma (who was 63 when she lost my grandpa, who was 76) was a home health care worker through the county part-time at that point and continued to work until she was 75 (probably should've retired a bit earlier, but she did it). My sister and I were very little then, and my parents ultimately moved closer to her around that time. I am sure having us in her life more regularly (she picked us up from elementary school every day until my mom was done with work) was a big boost to her mental health after my grandpa passed. I know you can't predict the future, but I am sure when you and your wife are ready to start a family, your mother will be delighted to be close to you and will have something positive to focus on.You should meet with an estate lawyer or financial planner that would be able to recommend the best course of actions. This way it's someone you can show the documents and numbers to. I guarantee they've seen this situation before and can recommend several options to help you.

To me though, if you don't mind living with your mom, would it be possible for you and your family to move into your parents house? It's a bigger house. Sounds like the loan was about the same initially, so probably similar mortgage to what you already pay. You can sell your house. There would need to be some sort of legal transfer of the house to you, but I'm sure there is something that can be done. That just makes the most sense to me if you don't mind living with your mom.The question to me is, where did the $400-500k go?

Did he invest somewhere, remodel the house, take up gambling, medical debts?

I would want to know how much and where is it now?Some thoughts that come to mind:
- sell the house
- consider bringing your mom to live with you. Losing a spouse must be insanely difficult to go through, sometimes the mental support is what’s needed most. Imo, 55+ communities won’t give that to up.
- if you are planning on looking for external care for your child (daycare), consider having your mom do it instead. She really doesn’t make much money, and with daycare expenses now youll probably come on top. More importantly, itll give your mom a renewed sense of purpose and attachment.You’re really not going to like my answer, and I’m okay accepting it’s probably your worse option.

Sell the house. Get as far away from Seattle as possible. It’s too expensive for an older widow. The $ your mom is making could be made in the middle of Kansas or Nebraska or Oklahoma, West Texas, maybe New Mexico, possibly Idaho, doing the same job. Housing there is what you make in a single year for a widowed lady with a spare room for her lovely kids to come visit. If she has a couple hundred k in equity, she walks away with cash after buying the new home and debt free. Unless there is retirement/pension you didn’t mention, she’s not retiring. It’s a sad reality. 

Alternatively, she sells the house, you sell your house, she goes in on the new house with you, and the equity she put into your house is your payment for taking care of her once she passes in hopefully 100 or more years. Also, if she does manage to retire, free babysitting 😜. 

Sorry for your loss OP. Keeping the house really IS her worst option. List it yesterday.Sorry, I’m just a nobody who stumbled on this thread and I don’t know a lot about US housing market nor about the culture around it.

You say you and your wife are about to try having babies and you’ll eventually have to move from where you live, so make your mum move near where you live as many said doesn’t make sense to me, since she’ll have to move again.

If your wife is ok with it (and if she’s not 100% agreeing don’t) the most sensible thing to me would be to sell your house, move in with your mum(she’s got 3 bedrooms)  and buy out part of the house or share the mortgage with her

This solution needs lots of elasticity and adaptation from all the people involved, but where I’m from it would be one of the main options.

I’m sorry for your lossShe could maybe rent out two of the three bedrooms if she's okay with longterm roommates at her age. That could cut the mortage in half at least, depending on how much rooms go for in your area (check craigslist).Living that close to Seattle you could easily rent it out for $4k+ that would cover mortgage and give you $1k monthly for savings. 

Let other people pay the mortgage for a year or so while you figure everything out. 

Since baby is not yet conceived/here move mom into spare bedroom while you figure out a better option.not sure why a 30 year mortgage is insane. No sense in funneling cash into a house if you will never actually pay it off any way. 

I agree with most people here probably best to sell the house. Renting is not a bad thing. It is a lifestyle choice and at her age it isn't a bad choice. If you ever move you will want her to stay close to you. You may even buy a bigger home in a couple years and want her to move in with you. Or she may want to move to a senior living community or she may need assisted living services. A house is great if you want to put down roots and live in it for 5+ years. Otherwise it is really not worth the money as we are seeing right now. You can't predict the market. No one expected buying last year to be met with insane interest rates and a stagnant marketI see two options.

1. Rent the house out. Have her find a place closer to you, possibly renting a room for now to save money and not be alone. Save the $25k for a rainy day. 

2. Sell the house, and look for a multi unit (&lt;4 units) property to purchase. They count the rent as income so you’ll be able to afford a bit more which will be helpful in the Seattle market. There are lots and lots of resources on this subject. I personally love Bigger Pockets. They have an excellent podcast and website full of information. 

Your mom can either leverage her capital to acquire assets or save it for future needs. Personally I’d leverage what you can and build more wealth so your mom can live comfortably on her own. This is 100% possible and there are plenty of people who have done this with far less capital to start.How were they expecting to pay for retirement?  They had $4k in retirement savings? 

How much was your father receiving in social security benefits?  Look up SS survivor benefits. If he was receiving significantly more than she, she should be able to claim his benefit instead of hers as his widow.  And the house needs to go.  Start there.What’s the rental market like? Can she rent out her place and find somewhere cheaper? Can she stay with you say 6 months to build up savings  to show the rental income can pay for a new place?

Is leaving the area a possibility for her - outside the Seattle area? 

Around here, rents are skyrocketing and hard to find. Also a neighbor of mine made her Home and Airbnb - she makes over 6k a months. I live in a suburb next to nothing fancy but she rents it at $185/night and it’s always booked because it’s so much better and cheaper than a hotel - she allows dogs and has a backyard. I’ve seen wedding parties there, sports clubs and bachelor parties. At $185 a night plus cleaning it’s a steal for them. 

I hope that’s helpful. Don’t make a rash decision - think this through and use her home ownership as an advantage.My mother-in-law found herself in a new house, newly divorced, big mortgage.  She renovated the downstairs to make it a rental suite and she has, at times, rented her spare bedroom to a boarder.  It allowed her to keep the house.  She also switched to an interest-only mortgage when she retired.  Although I question the wisdom of that, it does keep her independent and in her home.

Personally, I’d sell it, combine households, let grandma spend some time with the kids, contribute to the home expenses and take whatever equity she has and jam it into the bank for retirement.

The longer there is I decision, the more money is wasted.  If she waits too long, the house will go to foreclosure.Reverse mortgage?  Let her live out her final years stress free. With her situation she’s not leaving you anything anyways.Dude, you get a free babysitter if you mom moves in which I’m paying $2K a month for.Rent her house out and at a minimum break even. With a sub4% (guessing) rate, 10 years from now you’ll look like a genius. She’s 62 and will now rent a small place while still independently living. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. 

There’s a million options, but this is how I’d be with my family. Good luck!Have you looked into social security spousal benefits? I do not know much about it but remember a roommate saying his mom collected social sec of his dad after he passed.Also please Google “social security spousal benefits”.

Medicare is critical .So sorry for your loss.

Selling the house is the easiest option.  

What condition is the house in?  Does it need a lot of repairs or has any recent work been done to it?

Another angle to look at it is to turn the house into a rental.  Can the house fetch enough to cash flow on the property from a tenant, maybe another family?  Can an ADU be added to the property so she can live in the ADU and the main house rented?  That way equity is still being built while the mortgage is covered.

It’s not the perfect living situation but something to consider if she’s comfortable with something like that.Is anyone else wondering what was unexpected? I mean, no offense. 

It's just that the average lifespan for men on earth at 2020 was 69.8. 
Honestly. He was 2 years past the average expiration date. Why would anyone be surprised by this?The 30 year mortgage at 60-70 years old is worrying.

Some, but not all, adults think that they can let the debt “be someone else’s problem” when they die.

Others have already given the most clear path.  Sell mom’s home.  It’s a financial burden that no longer serves its purpose.

Mom should rent for the time being.  Long term plans can be made at your guys’ leisure from there.Where did the money they borrowed go?

Oops I think I misunderstood. They just bought this house. Correct me if I’m wrong, but yeah the house has to go.She sells the house.
Uses the surplus as a deposit on a much smaller/cheaper house/apartment.Would you reconsider moving into her house?  Is it a better family home if you are trying to have children?  Would you ever be able to afford something that large in that area?

In 2020 we moved states to be closer to my mom and purchased her house (my childhood home). She moved across the street to a one-level home that was better suited for retirement (my deceased grandmothers house, so she already owned it). 

We wouldn’t have been able to afford a house this large for our family without this arrangement. We now have two kids and having my mom here with us has been invaluable. She’s not our main source of childcare, but having her nearby for a back up has been wonderful for our family and as she ages having her next-door means that will be able to keep an eye on her and help her with her home.

When my grandmother purchased the house, she moved about 40 minutes from her last house so that my parents could keep an ion her. It meant that they were able to have her over for dinner a few nights a week and they could do it easy daily tasks, like taking her trash out that she could no longer handle, I’m not saying that these are things that you want to take on for your mother but if you think that they will be issues in the future you might want to plan for what’s going to happen 10 or 20 years from nowIt's probably best if mom moves in with you even if it's an air mattress in the living room type of situation. I'd say sell or rent out that old house as quickly as you can. Then, see about getting an extension to build a room or adu at your current house. I wouldn't waste my time and money tryna get her another place with her shit income. No offense, but she doesn't make enough to care for herself. In Colorado, hospice care avg out to $3000 a month, and retirement homes were $5000 a month. I'm fortunate to be a veteran, but I don't know how civilians afford it.Sell your House and move to your Mother. dont know if you and your Wife want and how complicated it would be for your Worl/life balance.Your mom’s income and net worth doesn’t support owning a house and having all the expense of taxes and utilities and maintenance that comes with it.  She needs to rent something small and inexpensive.  Once her current mortgage is paid off in the sale, invest the proceeds for her in something like VTI.

If you’re considering having her live with you, this will need to be a longer range plan as it doesn’t sound like you’re equipped for it currently.Anything against moving with your mom and taking over the mortgage? An elderly person living alone is not a good idea anywayRenting is financial black hole, typically best to be avoided.

Taking over your mother's mortgage and moving in would be the best option IMHO. You get to look after your mother in her autumn years, she gets to see her grandchild grow up, you and your wife get the support of an experienced mother on hand 24/7 if you need it. Your child also has the benefit of their nanny around 24/7. Financially it is the best option by a long long way for everyone, as well as socially (assuming you all get along well enough). May take time to secure employment but you have some time to find new jobs.

Next best option would be to sell the house and get a small one for mom that she can afford, or have her move in with you.

Do whatever comes easy, if it's a major struggle you're heading the wrong way.Move into the bigger house with Mom and rent or sell the townhouse. Would be nice to have her around for new baby when that time comesHow old is your mother and are there any like low income senior housing opportunities in your area? My father-in-law was basically homeless and we helped him get on a waiting list for senior housing which has fixed rent. The rent actually went down once he retired because it was based on his social security incomeHave a look at Social Security Survivor Benefit.  It can be quite a chunk of money, paid monthly, until she retires, when normal SS kicks in.I’m at the bottom of this thread so it may have been said already, 
Your mom is entitled to 1/2 your fathers Soc. Security if they were married.
Also, if she is just listed as a user on a C.C. she’s not required to pay off the debt.
Banks really don’t want you to know that &amp; you have to be vigilant about that.
Make sure you read up on any credit card perks.
Some have built in life Ins.
Something doesn’t sound right about the life ins.
To me just because he lost his job doesn’t dissolve years of paying into it.
But maybe the 25k is a payout for all previous premiums?
